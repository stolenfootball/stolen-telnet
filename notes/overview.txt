A TELNET connection is a TCP connection used to transmit data with interspersed TELNET control information

When a connection is established, each end is assumed to originate at a Network Virtual Terminal, or NVT.

NVT:
    An imaginary device which provides a standard, network wide representation of a canonical terminal
    All servers and clients map their existing terminals to an NVT

Both parties can request features above an beyond those of an NVT, but some rules apply:
    Parties can only request a change, they cannot announce what mode they are in
    If a party receives a request for a mode it is already in, it should not be acknowledged
    Whenever one party sends a command to a second party, whether as a request or and acknowledgement, and the command will have an affect on the processing of the data sent from the first party to the second, then the commmand must be inserted into the data stream at the point where it is desired for it to take affect.  (since some time will occur between an option request and acknowledgement, it is recommended that the data be buffered until the request is completed to hide the uncertainty period from the user)

    To prevent loops, if a request is rejected, it should not be repeated unless something changes

Request options:
    WILL XXX - a request sent by either party to indicate the sending party's desire to begin doing XXX
    DO XXX - a positive acknowledgement to WILL XXX
    DON'T XXX - a negative acknowledgement to WILL XXX

    DO XXX - request that the other party begin performing XXX
    WILL XXX - positive acknowledgement to DO XXX
    WON'T XXX - negative acknowledgement to DO XXX

Since the DON'T and WON'T options cannot leave less than an NVT in terms of options, there will always be a usable connection regardless
    As such, hosts just need a list of options they can support, and anything they can't understand just gets a rejection
